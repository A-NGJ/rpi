# skill-descriptions

## Purpose

Define the quality contract for the `description` field of every RPI skill so the skill is reliably triggered from natural conversation, not just slash commands. The contract covers structure (what each description must contain), voice (consistent across skills), disambiguation (between overlapping skills), and a measured acceptance threshold.

## Scenarios

### Description states a user goal in its first sentence
Given any RPI skill description
When the first sentence is inspected
Then it describes what the user gets — phrased as the user's goal — and does not describe the skill's mechanism, output format, or internal artifacts

### Description specifies when to invoke
Given any RPI skill description
When the description is inspected
Then it contains a sentence beginning with `Use when` that lists user-facing situations the skill should fire on

### Description includes verbatim user phrasings
Given any RPI skill description for which real user vocabulary has been sampled
When the trigger sentence is inspected
Then it quotes at least three user phrasings inside single or double quotes

### Overlapping skills include explicit negative gates
Given two RPI skills that share natural-language surface area — specifically `rpi-plan`↔`rpi-propose`, `rpi-research`↔`rpi-propose`, `rpi-research`↔`rpi-diagnose`, `rpi-blueprint`↔`rpi-propose`, `rpi-blueprint`↔`rpi-plan`, and `rpi-revise`↔`rpi-plan`
When each skill's description is inspected
Then it contains a sentence of the form `Do NOT invoke for X — use rpi-Y instead`, where rpi-Y is the named sibling

### Voice is consistent across all RPI skills
Given the descriptions of all RPI skills
When their trigger sentences are inspected
Then every one uses the imperative form `Use when …` — none use third-person variants such as `This skill should be used when …`

### Description triggers correctly on the manual eval prompt set
Given a manual eval covering all RPI skills — one representative trigger per skill plus disambiguation probes for the known overlap pairs (`rpi-plan`↔`rpi-propose`, `rpi-research`↔`rpi-propose`, `rpi-research`↔`rpi-diagnose`, `rpi-revise`↔`rpi-plan`), extended with external-research probes per `.rpi/specs/rpi-research-external-mode.md` (positive external-survey trigger, plus decision- and broken-behavior deferral probes for external systems)
When each prompt is run verbatim in a fresh Claude Code session with all RPI skills installed
Then the expected skill auto-fires (without slash-command invocation) on at least 80% of the prompts in the extended set total (not the 20-prompt subset alone)

### Eval prompt set is persisted alongside the descriptions
Given the manual eval prompt set used to validate description quality
When a description rewrite is merged
Then the prompt set is stored as a markdown file under the design's eval directory so the same prompts can be replayed when descriptions are later re-tuned

## Constraints
- Source of truth for skill files is `internal/workflow/assets/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Deployed copies under `.claude/skills/` are not edited directly.
- Each rewrite changes only the `description:` line in frontmatter. The body of every SKILL.md remains byte-identical to its pre-rewrite content.
- Compatibility with the existing Agent Skills format spec (`agent-skills.md`) remains intact: every skill still has `name` and `description`, every name still matches its parent directory and the naming regex.
- Voice convention is imperative (`Use when …`), applied uniformly across all RPI skills.
- Acceptance threshold: ≥80% pass rate (16/20) on the manual eval prompt set.
- The measurement methodology is manual: each prompt is run in a fresh Claude Code session with all RPI skills installed; the expected skill must auto-fire without slash-command invocation. Tooling-driven optimization (e.g. Anthropic's `skill-creator`) is permitted but not required.

## Out of Scope
- Triggering behavior of non-RPI skills installed alongside the RPI suite.
- Quality or content of SKILL.md bodies (this spec covers descriptions only).
- Adding, removing, or renaming skills.
- CLAUDE.md guidance that influences activation outside the description signal.
- Hooks, harness signals, or plugin-marketplace metadata.
- Automated CI integration of the eval (manual runs before merge are sufficient for v1).

## Update Log
- 2026-05-22 — Extended the manual eval with external-research probes per `.rpi/designs/2026-05-22-expand-rpi-research-to-cover-external-investigation.md`. The 20-prompt subset is preserved; the extended set adds at least one positive external-survey trigger and disambiguation probes against `rpi-propose` and `rpi-diagnose`. ≥80% threshold now applies to the extended set total.
- 2026-06-19 — Added `rpi-blueprint` to the overlapping-skills negative-gate coverage with the pairs `rpi-blueprint`↔`rpi-propose` and `rpi-blueprint`↔`rpi-plan` per `.rpi/designs/2026-06-17-rpi-blueprint-fused-fast-path.md`. The blueprint description must defer to `rpi-propose` on tradeoffs / high blast radius and to `rpi-plan` on narrow scoped changes.
- 2026-06-19 — Added `rpi-revise` to the overlapping-skills negative-gate coverage with the pair `rpi-revise`↔`rpi-plan`, plus a `rpi-revise`↔`rpi-plan` disambiguation probe in the manual eval, per `.rpi/designs/2026-06-17-rpi-revise-skill.md`. The revise description must fire on amending an existing plan and defer to `rpi-plan` for a fresh self-contained scoped change.
