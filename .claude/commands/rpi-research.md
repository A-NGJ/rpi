# Research Codebase

Conduct research across the codebase to answer user questions by spawning parallel sub-agents and synthesizing their findings.

## Why description-only (no recommendations)

This command is the first stage of a pipeline: **research → design → plan → implement**. Its output feeds directly into `/rpi-design`, which is where trade-off analysis and recommendations belong. Mixing recommendations into research muddies the handoff — the design stage needs a clean factual foundation to work from, not one already loaded with opinions. So your job here is to be a cartographer: map the terrain accurately and let the next stage decide where to build.

This means: describe what exists, where it lives, how components connect, and what patterns are in use. If you notice something interesting or unusual, document it as an observation ("this module uses pattern X while the rest of the codebase uses pattern Y") rather than as a recommendation ("this should be refactored to use Y").

## Step 1: Receive the query

If the user provided a research question or topic as command arguments, proceed directly to Step 2 — no need to prompt them.

If no arguments were provided, ask:
```
What would you like me to research? Provide a question, topic, or file path and I'll explore the codebase thoroughly.
```

## Step 2: Read mentioned files and check for existing research

- If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them fully (no limit/offset) before doing anything else. You need this context before you can decompose the research.
- Check `.thoughts/research/` for existing documents on the same topic. Use Glob and Grep to scan filenames and content.
  - If relevant research exists, tell the user: "I found existing research on this topic: [path]. Want me to build on it, or start fresh?"
  - If no relevant research exists, continue.

## Step 3: Assess scope and decompose

Not every question needs the same level of investigation. Before spawning sub-agents, assess the query:

- **Focused query** (e.g., "how does the categorization pipeline work?", "where is authentication handled?"): 1-2 targeted sub-agents are enough. Skip the full orchestration — just find the relevant code and explain it.
- **Broad query** (e.g., "document the entire data model", "how do all the services interact?"): Full decomposition with multiple parallel sub-agents across different areas.

For broad queries, break the question into composable research areas:
- Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
- Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant
- Create a task list to track subtasks

## Step 4: Spawn research sub-agents

Create Task sub-agents to research different aspects concurrently. Each sub-agent should load the appropriate skill, then perform its work.

**For codebase research:**
- Sub-task: "Load the `locate-codebase` skill, then find WHERE files and components live for [topic]"
- Sub-task (@codebase-analyzer): Understand HOW specific code works
- Sub-task: "Load the `find-patterns` skill, then find examples of existing patterns for [topic]"

**For thoughts directory:**
- Sub-task: "Load the `locate-thoughts` skill, then discover what documents exist about [topic]"
- Sub-task: "Load the `analyze-thoughts` skill, then extract key insights from [specific document paths]"

**For web research (optional):**
Only spawn web research sub-agents when:
1. The project is greenfield (little or no existing codebase)
2. The user explicitly asks for it (e.g., "also search the web", "what do the docs say")

When triggered, spawn 1-3 general-purpose sub-agents focused on different angles:
- Official documentation, APIs, and reference material
- Community knowledge — blog posts, Stack Overflow, GitHub issues
- Changelogs, migration guides, version-specific docs (if a library/framework is involved)

Each web research sub-agent should return findings with source URLs as markdown links.

**Skill usage strategy:**
- Start with locate skills (`locate-codebase`, `locate-thoughts`) to find what exists
- Then use analyzer skills (`analyze-thoughts`, `@codebase-analyzer`) on the most promising findings
- Run sub-agents in parallel when they're searching for different things
- For focused queries, you may only need 1-2 of these — use judgment

## Step 5: Checkpoint (broad queries only)

For broad research, after the initial locate sub-agents return but before deep analysis:

Present a brief summary of what was found and ask the user if they want to redirect focus:
```
Initial scan found these areas related to [topic]:
- [Area 1]: N files in path/to/...
- [Area 2]: N files in path/to/...
- [Area 3]: N files in path/to/...

Should I dig into all of these, or focus on specific areas?
```

Skip this checkpoint for focused queries — just proceed to synthesis.

## Step 6: Synthesize findings

Wait for all sub-agents to complete, then:

- Compile all results
- Prioritize live codebase findings as the primary source of truth
- Use .thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context
- If web research was performed, connect codebase findings to external docs and patterns
- Connect findings across different components
- Include specific file paths and line numbers
- Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence

## Step 7: Write the research document

**Filename:** `.thoughts/research/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
- Include ticket number if available: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`
- Without ticket: `2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md`

**Structure:** Use YAML frontmatter for metadata, keep the body focused on content. Only include sections that have actual findings — skip empty sections rather than leaving placeholders.

# Research: [User's Question/Topic]

## Research Question
[Original user query]

## Summary
[High-level answer to the user's question, describing what exists]

## Detailed Findings

### [Component/Area 1]
- Description of what exists (`file.ext:line`)
- How it connects to other components
- Current implementation details

### [Component/Area 2]
...

## Code References
- `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there
- `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block

## Architecture
[Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found]

## Web Research Findings
<!-- Include only if web research was performed -->

## Historical Context
<!-- Include only if .thoughts/ had relevant documents -->
- `.thoughts/research/something.md` - Historical decision about X

## Open Questions
[Any areas that need further investigation]
```

## Step 8: Present and follow up

- Present a concise summary of findings to the user
- Include key file references for easy navigation
- Ask if they have follow-up questions

**For follow-ups:** Append to the same research document rather than creating a new one. Add a `## Follow-up: [brief description]` section and update the frontmatter:
```yaml
last_updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
last_updated_by: [Researcher name]
last_updated_note: "Added follow-up research for [brief description]"
```

## Guidelines

- Use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency
- Always run fresh codebase research — existing .thoughts/ documents supplement but don't replace live findings
- Focus on concrete file paths and line numbers
- Research documents should be self-contained
- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis; delegate deep file reading to sub-agents
- Explore all of .thoughts/, not just the research subdirectory
- Read mentioned files fully before spawning sub-tasks
- Wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing
- Never write the research document with placeholder values
- Use snake_case for multi-word frontmatter fields
