# RPI Setup

## Goal

Install the `rpi` binary so the plugin's MCP server (`~/.rpi/bin/rpi serve`) and CLI subcommands work. Safely re-runnable — when the binary is already present, delegate to `rpi upgrade`. Refuse to proceed when a prior standalone install is detected and surface the remediation command.

The plugin writes the binary only to `~/.rpi/bin/rpi`. It does not touch `~/.local/bin`, shell rc files, PATH, or any other location.

## Invariants

- Download binaries only from official GitHub Releases under `A-NGJ/rpi`. No mirrors.
- Verify every download's SHA256 against the release's `checksums.txt` asset. On mismatch: delete the temp dir and abort with a clear error naming the expected and observed checksums. Leave no partial files at `~/.rpi/bin/`.
- The only filesystem mutation outside `~/.rpi/` is reading from network and writing to `mktemp -d` (which is cleaned up before return).
- Print what each step is about to do before executing.
- Never `sudo`. Never write outside `~/.rpi/`. Never modify the user's PATH.
- On any failure mid-flight: clean up the temp dir and exit non-zero with a clear message.

## Steps

Execute each step in order via Bash. Stop the flow if any step prints a remediation message (standalone conflict, unsupported platform, checksum failure).

### 1. Detect a prior standalone install

A standalone install — created by `rpi init --global` — leaves skills under `~/.claude/skills/rpi-*` and registers an `rpi` MCP server in `~/.claude/settings.json` outside the plugin. If detected, refuse and instruct the user to clean up first.

```sh
conflict=0
if ls -d "$HOME/.claude/skills/rpi-"* >/dev/null 2>&1; then conflict=1; fi
if [ -f "$HOME/.claude/settings.json" ] && grep -q '"rpi"' "$HOME/.claude/settings.json" 2>/dev/null; then
  # The plugin's MCP entry lives inside the plugin manifest, not here. Any
  # "rpi" reference at the user-level settings.json indicates a standalone
  # install (or a manually added server).
  conflict=1
fi
if [ "$conflict" = 1 ]; then
  echo "Standalone rpi install detected (skills under ~/.claude/skills/rpi-* or MCP entry in ~/.claude/settings.json)."
  echo "Run 'rpi uninstall --global' to remove the standalone install, then re-run /rpi:setup."
  exit 1
fi
```

### 2. Detect an existing plugin-mode install → delegate to `rpi upgrade`

If `~/.rpi/bin/rpi` already exists and works, this is a re-run. Hand off to the binary's own upgrade flow.

```sh
if [ -x "$HOME/.rpi/bin/rpi" ] && "$HOME/.rpi/bin/rpi" version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Existing rpi binary found at ~/.rpi/bin/rpi; delegating to 'rpi upgrade'..."
  "$HOME/.rpi/bin/rpi" upgrade
  exit $?
fi
```

### 3. Detect platform

```sh
uname_s=$(uname -s)
uname_m=$(uname -m)
case "$uname_s/$uname_m" in
  Darwin/arm64)  os=darwin; arch=arm64 ;;
  Darwin/x86_64) os=darwin; arch=amd64 ;;
  Linux/x86_64)  os=linux;  arch=amd64 ;;
  Linux/aarch64) os=linux;  arch=arm64 ;;
  *)
    echo "Unsupported platform: $uname_s/$uname_m. Supported: darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, linux/amd64, linux/arm64."
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
echo "Platform detected: $os/$arch."
```

### 4. Fetch release metadata

```sh
echo "Fetching latest release metadata from GitHub..."
meta=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/A-NGJ/rpi/releases/latest) || {
  echo "Failed to fetch release metadata."; exit 1;
}
# goreleaser strips the leading "v" from the tag in the archive name.
tag=$(printf '%s' "$meta" | jq -r .tag_name)
version=${tag#v}
archive_name="rpi_${version}_${os}_${arch}.tar.gz"
archive_url=$(printf '%s' "$meta" | jq -r ".assets[] | select(.name == \"$archive_name\") | .browser_download_url")
checksums_url=$(printf '%s' "$meta" | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name == "checksums.txt") | .browser_download_url')
if [ -z "$archive_url" ] || [ "$archive_url" = "null" ]; then
  echo "Release $tag has no asset named $archive_name. Aborting."
  exit 1
fi
echo "Latest release: $tag → $archive_name"
```

### 5. Download archive and checksums into a temp dir

```sh
tmp=$(mktemp -d) || { echo "mktemp failed."; exit 1; }
trap 'rm -rf "$tmp"' EXIT INT TERM
echo "Downloading $archive_name and checksums.txt into $tmp..."
curl -fsSL -o "$tmp/$archive_name"  "$archive_url"  || { echo "Download failed: $archive_url";  exit 1; }
curl -fsSL -o "$tmp/checksums.txt"  "$checksums_url" || { echo "Download failed: checksums.txt"; exit 1; }
```

### 6. Verify SHA256

```sh
# Compute archive SHA256 — prefer shasum (macOS), fall back to sha256sum (Linux).
if command -v shasum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  observed=$(shasum -a 256 "$tmp/$archive_name" | awk '{print $1}')
else
  observed=$(sha256sum "$tmp/$archive_name" | awk '{print $1}')
fi
expected=$(awk -v n="$archive_name" '$2 == n {print $1}' "$tmp/checksums.txt")
if [ -z "$expected" ]; then
  echo "Could not find $archive_name in checksums.txt. Aborting."
  exit 1
fi
if [ "$observed" != "$expected" ]; then
  echo "SHA256 mismatch for $archive_name:"
  echo "  expected: $expected"
  echo "  observed: $observed"
  echo "Aborting. No files installed."
  exit 1
fi
echo "SHA256 OK: $observed"
```

### 7. Extract and install

```sh
echo "Extracting and installing to ~/.rpi/bin/rpi..."
mkdir -p "$HOME/.rpi/bin"
tar -xzf "$tmp/$archive_name" -C "$tmp"
install -m 0755 "$tmp/rpi" "$HOME/.rpi/bin/rpi"
```

### 8. PATH hint

```sh
echo
echo "rpi binary installed at: $HOME/.rpi/bin/rpi"
echo "The plugin's MCP server points here directly — no PATH change required."
echo "To invoke 'rpi' from your shell, add this to your shell rc:"
echo "  export PATH=\"\$HOME/.rpi/bin:\$PATH\""
```

### 9. Confirm

```sh
"$HOME/.rpi/bin/rpi" version || { echo "Installed binary did not run."; exit 1; }
echo "Setup complete."
```

## Behavioral guarantees

- After step 1 fires with `conflict=1`, no further steps run — the binary is not downloaded.
- After step 2 succeeds (delegated upgrade), the function returns the binary's own upgrade exit code; no files under the plugin directory are modified.
- The `trap 'rm -rf "$tmp"' EXIT INT TERM` line ensures temp-dir cleanup on every exit path, including the SHA256 mismatch case.
- The only file ever written outside `$tmp` is `$HOME/.rpi/bin/rpi`.
