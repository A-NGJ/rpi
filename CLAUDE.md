# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

This project introduces a structured workflow for software development, emphasizing clear documentation, incremental implementation, and rigorous testing.

It consists of the following key components:
- **RPI Workflow**: A set of commands for the Research-Propose-Plan-Implement workflow in form of commands and skills in markdown format.
- **RPI Binary**: A command-line tool to manage the RPI workflow, written in go.

## Git Workflow 

When committing changes, always ask the user which files/directories to include before proposing commits. Never assume all unstaged/staged changes should be committed.

## Thoughts Directory

This project uses a `.thoughts/` directory for persistent context:

```
.thoughts/
├── research/      # Codebase research notes (optional, from /rpi-research)
├── proposals/     # Solution proposals (created by /rpi-propose)
├── plans/         # Implementation plans (created by /rpi-plan)
├── specs/         # Living behavioral specs
├── reviews/       # Verification reports
├── prs/           # PR descriptions
├── archive/       # Archived completed artifacts
```


### Usage

- **Research**: Save exploration findings in `.thoughts/research/`
- **Proposals**: Record investigation findings and design decisions in `.thoughts/proposals/`
- **Plans**: Store implementation plans in `.thoughts/plans/`
- **Specs**: Maintain behavioral specs in `.thoughts/specs/`

### Conventions

- The `.thoughts/` directory is gitignored
- Use descriptive filenames: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`
- Proposals go in `.thoughts/proposals/`. Implementation plans go in `.thoughts/plans/`. Never save planning artifacts in the project root or other directories unless explicitly told otherwise.

### Development Pipeline

See `.thoughts/PIPELINE.md` for the full workflow guide covering: Research → Propose → Plan → Implement.

### RPI CLI

The `rpi` binary manages `.thoughts/` artifacts. See `.rpi/cli-reference.md` for all available commands and flags. Run `rpi init --update` to regenerate after CLI changes.

## Implementing Plans

- When implementing a plan from `.thoughts/plans/`, present intended changes for each phase before writing code. Pause between phases for manual verification. Update checkboxes in the plan file as items complete, and resume from the first unchecked item if checkboxes already exist.
- After implementing changes, always run the full test suite before commiting. If tests fail, fix them before presenting the commit plan.
Tests commonly break due to: outdated fixture values, incorrect mock setup, and missing edge cases.

## Development Conventions

Before implementing any changes, always: 1) Read the current version of each file you plan to modify, 2) Run the existing test suite to establish a baseline, 3) Implement changes incrementally — one logical unit at a time, 4) Run tests after each unit. If tests fail, fix before proceeding. Do not batch all changes and test at the end.

## Testing 

After implementing changes, always run the full test suite before committing. If tests fail, fix them before presenting the commit plan. Tests commonly break due to: outdated fixture values, incorrect mock setup, and missing edge cases.

## Communication Style

When the user says 'looks good' or similar short affirmations during planning, proceed immediately with implementation. Do not elaborate further on the plan or ask for additional confirmation.

## Debugging

When the user reports a bug with a concrete example, reproduce the exact example first before proposing a fix. Do not assume you understand the issue until you've verified with the user's specific data.
