AI coding agents are capable -- the challenge is steering them. Without structure, you end up re-running prompts hoping the output lands closer to what you actually need. RPI gives you a framework to direct that capability: staged decisions, reviewable artifacts, and behavioral specs that keep work on track.

Each stage produces a document you can read, edit, and approve before the next one starts. A compiled Go CLI handles the bookkeeping so the LLM spends its tokens on thinking, not parsing. Built for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode), but the methodology works with any AI coding tool.

Best fit: solo devs and teams who want control over their AI dev flow — review where it matters, keep a durable trace of decisions, and split work across sessions without losing context.

## Quick Start

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add A-NGJ/rpi
/plugin install rpi@rpi
/rpi:rpi-setup
```

These register the marketplace, install the plugin (skills, hooks, MCP server), and fetch the `rpi` binary into `~/.rpi/bin/rpi`. **First-time only: restart Claude Code after the third command** so the `rpi` MCP server can launch. For OpenCode, standalone, global, or from-source installs, see [Installation](#installation).

## What RPI helps with

| What's hard | RPI's answer |
|---|---|
| Pointing the agent at what's already in your codebase before it acts | `/rpi-research` (primary), `/rpi-propose` for tradeoff decisions |
| Keeping a durable source of truth for what the system is supposed to do | `.rpi/specs/` (living behavioral contracts) |
| Confirming the code matches intent, not just that it compiles | `/rpi-verify` (severity-classified spec conformance) |
| Reviewing big changes before they're written, not after | per-phase verification + checkboxes in `/rpi-implement` |
| Splitting work across sessions without re-explaining context | persistent `.rpi/` artifacts + `rpi resume` |

## See It in Action

You have a product with real data — and users keep asking, "can I just ask it questions in plain English?" Add an agentic workflow on top of what you already have, without rebuilding it:

```
/rpi-research What do we have today, and where could an agent plug in?
```
Brainstorm with Claude: it explores the data model, the query path, and the auth boundary, then surfaces the natural seams where an agent can attach. Optionally writes findings to `.rpi/research/`.

```
/rpi-propose Add an AI chat over our data
```
Crystallizes the brainstorm into 2-3 concrete approaches — each with tradeoffs grounded in what research found. You pick. Writes `.rpi/designs/` and a behavioral spec. A read-only pre-lock audit checks the drafted components cohere — coverage, cross-component mismatch, decision-drift — before you approve.

```
/rpi-plan .rpi/designs/2026-03-04-data-agent.md
```
Decomposes into phases — each with file changes, verification commands, and success criteria. Writes `.rpi/plans/`. A read-only pre-lock audit flags forward-references and coverage gaps in the drafted phases before you approve.

```
/rpi-implement .rpi/plans/2026-03-04-data-agent.md
```
Executes phase-by-phase: tests between each, commits as it goes, pauses only on manual verification or plan divergence.

```
/rpi-verify .rpi/plans/2026-03-04-data-agent.md
```
Closes the loop. Extracts Given/When/Then scenarios from the linked specs, checks each against the actual code and tests, and emits a severity-classified report in `.rpi/reviews/`. A read-only grounding pass then re-anchors each finding against the actual repo and demotes any blocker it can't confirm, so you get fewer false-positive blockers. **Don't skip this** -- "tests pass" is not the same as "the implementation matches what you designed." Verify is what catches the gap between intent and code before it ships.

## Try it

```
/rpi-plan Fix the date formatter in utils/dates.ts that returns "NaN" for ISO strings
```
Claude investigates, writes a phased plan to `.rpi/plans/`.

```
/rpi-implement .rpi/plans/2026-04-08-fix-date-formatter.md
```
Review the changes, approve, done. See the [full workflow guide](docs/workflow-guide.md) for more.

## The Slash Commands

| Command | What It Does | Output |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `/rpi-research` | Investigates a question -- codebase or external, with conversational fact-finding | Conversation (optionally `.rpi/research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`) |
| `/rpi-propose` | Investigates, analyzes, and designs solutions with trade-offs | `.rpi/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` + `.rpi/specs/feature.md` |
| `/rpi-plan` | Creates phased implementation plan with success criteria | `.rpi/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` |
| `/rpi-blueprint` | Fused shortcut: research note or short problem statement → phased plan in one pass, no separate design | `.rpi/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` + `.rpi/specs/feature.md` |
| `/rpi-implement` | Executes a plan phase-by-phase with verification | Code, tests, and commits |
| `/rpi-revise` | Amends an existing plan for a new constraint or review finding -- preserves completed work, re-audits only changed phases, hands back to implement | Updated `.rpi/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` |
| `/rpi-commit` | Creates focused git commits with smart grouping | Git commits |
| `/rpi-verify` | Validates implementation matches design artifacts | `.rpi/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` |
| `/rpi-diagnose` | Iterative root-cause analysis for complex bugs | `.rpi/diagnoses/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` + fix |
| `/rpi-explain` | Diff-scoped walkthrough of an implemented solution | Conversation |
| `/rpi-spec-sync` | Syncs specs to match current codebase (detect drift, rewrite, rename, merge) | Updated `.rpi/specs/` |
| `/rpi-archive` | Archives completed artifacts to keep `.rpi/` clean | Moves files to `.rpi/archive/` |
| `/rpi-handoff` | Captures in-flight session context to a per-project temp file so the next session can resume | `/tmp/claude-handoff-<sha>.md` |

> **Modes.** `/rpi-propose` and `/rpi-plan` accept `--grill` (or "grill me on this") — hands off to the bundled [`grill-me`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) skill for adversarial, one-question-at-a-time interrogation of the draft. `/rpi-propose`, `/rpi-plan`, and `/rpi-implement` also accept `--ff` (fast-forward) — suppresses approval gates and auto-chains to `/rpi-verify`, stopping only on safety gates (codebase drift, sensitive content). Mutually exclusive with `--grill`.

## How RPI Is Different

RPI combines two things other tools don't: **reviewable artifacts that keep a human in the loop at every stage**, and a **compiled Go CLI exposed over MCP that keeps mechanical work out of the LLM's context window**. Scaffolding, frontmatter parsing, artifact-chain traversal, status transitions, checkbox counting, and section extraction all run in the binary -- the LLM sees a small JSON result, not the raw files or shell output. That alone saves thousands of tokens per multi-stage feature and lets the model spend its budget on the actual problem. Separating thinking from doing -- research gathers facts, propose makes decisions, plan specifies changes, implement executes them -- means review checkpoints catch bad decisions early, not after 500 lines of wrong code. All artifacts live in `.rpi/`, so context persists across sessions and teams. And by breaking work into stages, each conversation stays scoped to one job, keeping the context window small and output quality high.

**vs. [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec)** -- OpenSpec gives the AI more autonomy, implementing an entire plan in one pass. RPI gives you fine-grained control -- you review each implementation phase before it's executed, with git commits between phases for versioning and easy rollback. RPI also gives you full ownership of every command and skill -- they're plain markdown files you can read, edit, and customize after `rpi init`. OpenSpec's prompts are compiled into its npm package and regenerated on `openspec update`, so the workflow logic stays inside the tool rather than in your project.

**vs. unstructured prompting** -- Without stage boundaries, the LLM researches, designs, and implements in a single pass -- no checkpoints, no review, no way to course-correct before code is written.

## MCP Server (big token savings)

The `rpi` binary doubles as an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server. Running `rpi serve` starts a stdio-based server that exposes all CLI operations as typed tools (`rpi_scaffold`, `rpi_scan`, `rpi_chain`, `rpi_frontmatter_get`, etc.). AI assistants call these tools with validated JSON schemas instead of constructing shell commands.

**Why it matters.** The MCP layer is the single biggest reason RPI stays cheap to run on long projects. Every artifact lookup, frontmatter read, status transition, chain traversal, checkbox count, and section extraction is done by the Go binary -- the LLM never sees the raw YAML, the directory walk, the git output, or the markdown bodies it doesn't need. Each MCP call returns a small, validated JSON payload instead of dumping a file (or a directory) into the context window. On a typical multi-stage feature the savings stack into thousands of tokens per session, which translates directly into a smaller context, longer sessions before compaction, and better output quality. Skills and `rpi` agents call these tools automatically; you don't have to think about it.

`rpi init` (and the Claude Code plugin install) auto-registers the MCP server when both `rpi` and `claude` are in your PATH. Use `--no-mcp` to skip this. See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for the full list of operations the binary handles for you.

## Choosing Your Path

Not every task needs every stage. Match the path to your task's complexity:

- **Small tasks** (bug fixes, config changes) -- skip straight to **Plan -> Implement**. `/rpi-plan` does lightweight research on the fly.
- **Medium tasks** (focused features, single-concern changes) -- use **Propose -> Plan -> Implement**. Optionally run `/rpi-research` first if the codebase is unfamiliar.
- **Large tasks** (multi-concern features, major refactors) -- use **Propose -> Plan -> Implement**, where `/rpi-plan` decomposes the proposal into independently plannable units.
- **Low-stakes solo work** -- use `/rpi-blueprint` to go from a research note or short problem statement straight to a plan in one pass, skipping the separate design deliverable (it still writes a minimal spec and records its design reasoning in a `## Design Notes` plan block). This is the *fused* shortcut, distinct from `--ff` (runs the full pipeline fast but still produces a design) and from `/rpi-plan` (scoped change to existing behavior, no design reasoning). It refuses and redirects to `/rpi-propose` when the work carries genuine tradeoffs or wide blast radius.

Not sure where to start? Use `/rpi-research` with any question -- it handles both focused investigation and open-ended research. For complex bugs, use `/rpi-diagnose` to iterate on root-cause analysis.

Not sure what's in flight, or coming back after a break? Run `rpi status` for a dashboard of artifacts and progress, or `rpi resume` for a session-level overview — active/draft artifacts, the current phase of the most recent plan, and a suggested next action. Claude Code calls `rpi resume` automatically on session start so the assistant orients itself before you type.

## Installation

### Claude Code plugin (recommended)

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add A-NGJ/rpi
/plugin install rpi@rpi
/rpi:rpi-setup
```

The first two register the marketplace and install the plugin (skills, hooks, MCP server). The third downloads the matching release, verifies its SHA256 against `checksums.txt`, and installs the binary at `~/.rpi/bin/rpi`. Re-running upgrades in place. The plugin writes nothing outside `~/.rpi/bin/`.

**Plugin command names.** Triggers are `/rpi:rpi-plan`, `/rpi:rpi-implement`, `/rpi:rpi-verify`, etc. — skill folders keep the `rpi-` prefix so Claude Code's namespace-stripping picker stays unambiguous. The MCP server name (`rpi`) and tool prefix (`mcp__rpi__*`) are unchanged.

If you previously installed via `rpi init --global`, run `rpi uninstall --global` before `/rpi:rpi-setup` — the plugin refuses to overwrite a standalone install. See the [plugin README](claude-plugin/README.md) for the full marketplace listing.

### OpenCode and standalone CLI

For OpenCode users or environments without the Claude Code plugin marketplace:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/A-NGJ/rpi/main/install.sh | bash
rpi init                                         # current directory, Claude Code
rpi init /path/to/project --target opencode      # OpenCode in a different directory
```

`rpi init` creates the Agent Skills directory (`.claude/` or `.opencode/`), `.rpi/` for pipeline artifacts, a project instructions file (`CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`), and (Claude Code only) MCP server registration.

```bash
VERSION=v0.3.0 curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/A-NGJ/rpi/main/install.sh | bash   # pin a version
rpi upgrade               # update the binary
rpi update                # sync project workflow files
rpi uninstall --global    # remove everything RPI owns (detects plugin- vs standalone-mode; user entries in settings.json preserved)
```

### One-time global setup

Optional, for users who work across many repos. Installs skills, agents, and the MCP server at the user level once:

```bash
rpi init --global                          # ~/.claude/
rpi init --global --target opencode        # ~/.config/opencode/
rpi update --global                        # refresh the global install
```

`--global` writes only to your user config directory — no `.rpi/`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `.gitignore` is touched. See [docs/rpi-init.md](docs/rpi-init.md) for the full layout.

### From source

Requires Go 1.25+. Either install directly or clone and build:

```bash
go install github.com/A-NGJ/rpi/cmd/rpi@latest                              # direct
git clone https://github.com/A-NGJ/rpi && cd rpi && make install            # clone + build (copies to ~/.local/bin)
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` (or your chosen install dir) is in your PATH.

### Upgrading

```bash
rpi upgrade    # download and install the latest release
```
Plugin users can re-run `/rpi:rpi-setup` (which delegates to `rpi upgrade`).

## Optional: Semantic Search

`rpi serve` exposes an `rpi_search` MCP tool that returns ranked, semantically relevant `.rpi/` artifacts for a natural-language query. When the optional [qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) backend is installed, seven skills (`rpi-research`, `rpi-propose`, `rpi-plan`, `rpi-verify`, `rpi-explain`, `rpi-diagnose`, `rpi-spec-sync`) call it automatically before producing artifacts. Without qmd, the same skills fall back to keyword scan — RPI ships fully functional without it.

See [docs/semantic-search.md](docs/semantic-search.md) for installation, warmup, the status contract, and troubleshooting.
